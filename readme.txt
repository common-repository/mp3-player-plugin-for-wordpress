This is a great way to get your music out there either through just listening or having some music on your site.

Check this page for usage for embedding into posts/pages [Test MP3 Player](http://www.thomasnorberg.com/plugins-used/test-mp3-player/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the whole plugin folder mp3player.zip to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress by clicking "MP3 Player plugin"
3. Go to your Options Panel and open the 'MP3 options' submenu. /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=mp3options
4. Go to widgets submenu under Appearance Panel and activate widget title "MP3 Player plugin". /wp-admin/widgets.php 
5. You can also activate it anywhere in your wordpress site by adding &lt;?php mp3_embed() ?&gt;
6. You can also add a RSS link to those .mp3 files anywhere in your wordpress site by adding &lt;?php RSS_embed(); ?&gt;
7. Only .mp3 files work with this plugin. (upload files to /wp-content/plugins/mp3&#95;player&#95;options/mp3 )
